What are the key factors and policies the government of India needs to consider in order to strive towards a greater economic growth? 

<ins>(C)Movitation/Puzzle:<ins>

One of the factors that contribute towards power ranking of a country is its economy. In a world where countries are competitive on having the strongest and fastest growing economy, governments of these countries must figure ethical and viable methods in order to keep up with the rest of the world. With first world countries already ahead of the developing countries, we will be focusing our research on India, an emerging developing country. As of 2020 India currently sits at 124th in economy ranking. The Government of India would need to be able to analyze their current state of economy as well as forecast the future state of economy in order to realize if any change is necessary. With further analysis, the government would be able to employ the right policies accordingly in order to climb the economic ranking 

<ins>(D)Idea ? : <ins>

The Core idea here is that by looking at data on Economic Coincident factors such as, employment, real earning, unemployment rate and average weekly hours worked in manufacturing, the government of India would be able to analyze the current state of the economy. Further the Indian government would then collect data on Economic Indicators such as inflation, interest rates, industrial production, worker productivity, retail sales and real GDP. These indicators would allow us to analyze the economic performance and be able to predict the future state of the economy.  After analyzing and figuring on which factors are hindering a higher economic growth, the Indian government will then have the chance to implement different policies accordingly. In the end the aim is to increase Indiaâ€™s future economy by implementing policies.
