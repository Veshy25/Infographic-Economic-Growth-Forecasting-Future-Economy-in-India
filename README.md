<ins>(A) Research Title:<ins>

>Current Economic Growth & Forecasting Future Economy in India 

<ins>(B) Basic Research Question:<ins> 

>What are the key factors and policies the government of India needs to consider in order to strive towards a greater economic growth? 

<ins>(C) Movitation/Puzzle:<ins>

>One of the factors that contribute towards power ranking of a country is its economy. In a world where countries are competitive on having the strongest and fastest growing economy, governments of these countries must figure ethical and viable methods in order to keep up with the rest of the world. With first world countries already ahead of the developing countries, we will be focusing our research on India, an emerging developing country. As of 2020 India currently sits at 124th in economy ranking. The Government of India would need to be able to analyze their current state of economy as well as forecast the future state of economy in order to realize if any change is necessary. With further analysis, the government would be able to employ the right policies accordingly in order to climb the economic ranking 

<ins>(D) Idea ? : <ins>

>The Core idea here is that by looking at data on Economic Coincident factors such as, employment, real earning, unemployment rate and average weekly hours worked in manufacturing, the government of India would be able to analyze the current state of the economy. Further the Indian government would then collect data on Economic Indicators such as inflation, interest rates, industrial production, worker productivity, retail sales and real GDP. These indicators would allow us to analyze the economic performance and be able to predict the future state of the economy.  After analyzing and figuring on which factors are hindering a higher economic growth, the Indian government will then have the chance to implement different policies accordingly. In the end the aim is to increase India’s future economy by implementing policies. 

<ins>(E) Data? : <ins> 

>(1) The data type proposed for this pitch would be country specific, which will be looking for data collected on India, as the focus is on improving India’s economic growth. Data that will be used are on Economic Coincident factors as well as Economic indicator which would have the years ranging from 2000 – 2020 at an annual sample interval.

>(2) Sample Size: Focusing on one country, India’s, Economic Coincident Factors and Economic Indicator. The data for the factors will follow time-series and panel set in order analyze how the economy has fared, their current economy growth as well as to be able to predict the future economy.  

>(3) Data Source(s): All data collected would be from past and previous years available from sites such as “Data World : https://data.world/ ” , “Federal Bank of St. Louis : https://fred.stlouisfed.org/” , “https://www.investing.com/” and “Trading Economic : https://tradingeconomics.com/”  

>(4) The collected data may need to be converted in units, or rearranged accordingly to be able to make proper inference when creating charts and infographics. May not have any issues with missing data in the required time frame for the needed factors. 

>(5) Data collected will only be from reliable, known sources and therefore will be of quality since the data is used in other international researchers.  

<ins> (F) Tools ? <ins>
>Quantitative data in time series will be collected and if necessary be manipulated and rearranged accordingly through Microsoft Excel. The data collected then will be imported to Tableau to visualize in possible line chart for time series data to make inference from past to predict future as well as bar chart to analyze current economic data. May have the possibility to conjoin bar chart and line chart as well as Pie Chart to visualize the factors percentage combing to form the current economy. 

<ins> (G) What's New ? <ins> 
>Anticipated to find correlation between factors, such as unemployment and workers productivity, which will then lead on to the level effectiveness each factor has to contribute for economic growth

<ins> (H) So What? <ins> 
>The analysis performed will be of use to the Indian Government to improve their economic growth. They will also have insight on how their economy has faired in the recent years and their current  standing. Therefore, from the analysis provided from the research the government would be able to implement the right policies in legal manner. Successful implementation and an accomplished higher growth of the economy will allow the Indian citizens to have more trust on their government as well as give confidence for foreign direct investors which will further strengthen the economy. This will also put India on the ladder to higher ranking economy along side first world countries.  

<ins> (I) Contributions ? <ins>
>The main audience for this pitch is the Indian Government in hopes to increase their economic growth. The data analysis along with the infographic will also aid investors and foreign companies in investment decisions within the emerging economy.

<ins> (J) Other Considerations ? <ins>
>This pitch will only be focusing only several factors of Economic Indicators as well as Economic Coincident Factors. There are many more factors which would affect the growth of the economy which would also include qualitive (text-based) data that is difficult and time consuming in order to analyze and will not be able to include accordingly in the given time frame and manpower for the project.
